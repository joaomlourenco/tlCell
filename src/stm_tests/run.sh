#this is just an example

TRACE_START=5000 TRACE_DURATION=200 ./bin/rbtree 100 2 45 45 10 1000 500

#this will generate a file named trace.txt with the tracing events collected
# In this example the tracer will start collect events five seconds after
# the program started and will collect for about 200 miliseconds
